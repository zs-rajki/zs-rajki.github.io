                            My name is <span>Zsombor Rajki</span>, a second-year <span>Computer Science</span> student at <span>Eindhoven University of Technology</span>. I'm originally from <span>Hungary</span> and now based in <span>the Netherlands</span>.
                            I'm passionate about problem-solving, mathematics, and creating technology that combines functionality with thoughtful design.
                            My journey into computer science began with simple curiosity, which grew into a strong drive to learn, build, and challenge myself.
                            I see computer science as a powerful tool for bringing ideas to life. It blends logic, creativity, and persistence to create meaningful and intuitive solutions.
                            Alongside my studies, I work on real-world projects, including developing computer vision systems for a beach-cleaning robot, as well as several personal side projects.
                            In my free time, I find inspiration in movies, hiking and nature. I'm always aiming to stay curious and keep growing.

                    I've learned some of these tools through my studies at university, while others I've picked up on my own.
                    I prefer project-based learning, so I focus on deepening my knowledge by creating more complex programs using these tools.
                    However, I don't want to get comfortable and let familiarity hold me back from learning new things, so
                    I'm always expanding my toolkit and ready to explore new technologies.

                        I always wanted to learn <span>app development</span>, so when I found the online course <span>100 Days of SwiftUI</span> by <span>Paul Hudson</span>, I knew this would be my next long-term project.
                        As the name suggests, you gain the essential skills for building quality <span>iOS apps</span> using the <span>SwiftUI framework</span> over a 100-day curriculum.
                        It begins with learning the <span>Swift programming language</span>, then the focus shifts to Apple's own framework by creating <span>25</span> mini-apps to gain hands-on experience with SwiftUI.
                        The workload and complexity gradually increase as you progress, covering the most important topics an app developer needs, from networking to accessibility.
                        Beyond technical skills, this course taught me the power of persistence. Committing <span>1-2 hours a day</span> to a side project for 100 days was challenging, especially in the beginning,
                        but I learned that real progress comes from <span>small, consistent steps</span>, and it prepared me for bigger challenges.

                        When I started university, one of my first courses was 2IP90 - Programming, where I learned about <span>Java</span> and <span>object-oriented programming</span>.
                        One of our major assignments was a <span>challenge-based learning project</span>, where we had to create a game in pairs using the tools and techniques we had learned during the course.
                        Since neither my partner nor I had significant prior programming experience, we chose a simple idea and focused on making the most of it.
                        The game is a two-player, 2D, retro-styled <span>catching game</span>, where the blue character (controlled with WASD) tries to catch the red one (controlled with the arrow keys) as quickly as possible.
                        You can choose to play on a <span>pre-defined map</span> or a <span>randomly generated one</span>.
                        Throughout the project, we gained valuable experience with <span>version control</span>, <span>collaboration</span>, <span>object-oriented design</span>, the <span>Swing library</span>,
                        and <span>Java</span> itself. Despite its simplicity, we built a robust game and received nearly full marks for the assignment.

                        In <span>September 2024</span>, I joined a student team at my university called <span>GAIA Robotics</span>.
                        The team's mission is to develop autonomous robots that address environmental challenges such as coastal and urban cleaning, emergency response, demining post-war areas, reforestation, and more.
                        I was drawn to the idea of using my <span>technical skills</span> to help <span>protect and restore our environment</span>.
                        I am part of the <span>AI&ML department</span> (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning), where I work on <span>computer vision</span> and <span>image detection</span> for our prototype.
                        Right now, we are focusing on <span>fine-tuning</span> a <span>YOLO</span> model and optimizing its performance on relatively simple hardware.
                        This is a large-scale project that involves <span>extensive research</span>, <span>careful planning and coordination</span>, and <span>collaboration across multiple disciplines</span>.
                        It's a great opportunity to learn <span>new skills</span>, tackle <span>real-life challenges</span> beyond the classroom, and collaborate with like-minded peers.

                        This is another university project, this time for the course <span>2IRR00 - Software Design</span>.
                        In a small team, we built a <span>Java Maven application</span> that can be used to edit and solve a logic puzzle.
                        We chose <span>Sujiko</span>, a <span>Japanese logic puzzle</span> played on a 3x3 grid, where four circled number clues at the center of each quadrant indicate the sum of the four numbers in that quadrant.
                        The numbers 1-9 must be placed in the grid according to these clues to complete the puzzle.
                        Our application can <span>solve the puzzle</span>, provide <span>basic hints</span>, check your solution, and <span>highlight cells</span> based on your progress.
                        It also allows you to <span>edit or create puzzles</span>, use <span>undo/redo</span> while solving, and <span>save or load puzzle files</span> with your current state.
                        In the end, it became a fairly complex application, so we made sure to apply various <span>software design patterns</span> and <span>principles</span>, which was also one of the main goals of the assignment.

                        I always wanted to create a website for myself, but when I decided to work on more and bigger personal projects, I knew I should start with a <span>portfolio website</span> where I can showcase my work.
                        To my surprise, we don't really learn how to build websites at the university, so this was a skill I had to pick up entirely on my own.
                        And oh boy, had I known what I was in for! When you start looking into <span>web development</span>, even for a simple static website, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the countless frameworks, tools, and best practices out there.
                        But it didn't take long for me to realize that for a portfolio website, I could keep the <span>tech stack</span> simple. Instead of spending days watching tutorials on the latest libraries, I chose to dive in and learn by <span>building</span>.
                        I decided to create a fully <span>responsive</span>, <span>modern website</span> using plain <span>HTML</span>, <span>vanilla CSS</span>, and a little <span>JavaScript</span>.
                        I designed the entire layout in <span>Figma</span>, which made the coding process smoother since I already had a structured prototype to follow.
                        What amazed me most was how limitless creating it felt as I didn't really have to compromise on the design, even though it was my first time building a website from scratch.
                        That said, this is definitely one of those projects that will never truly be finished. I'm always finding small improvements and making changes here and there.
