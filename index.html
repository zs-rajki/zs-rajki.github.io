                One can find many moral issues that arise regarding Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), but the most significant is the way how the industry leading tech companies, such as Neuralink, get, store and use the data given by their innovative technology. Brain Computer Interfaces use a connection that humanity has never experienced before in terms of the “company-user” relation, because with these high-tech chips one would allow these companies to have the ability to read, monitor and sometimes even control every reaction and connection in one’s brain, which can be regarded as the highest form of power in today’s data driven world. But with great power comes great responsibility, so the question is whether Neuralink as a company has the virtuous characteristics to handle such a complicated and dangerous situation.
To dive more into the details, I will apply the theory of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is a moral philosophy focusing on the development of good character traits (virtues) such as courage, wisdom, temperance, and justice. These virtues enable individuals to lead fulfilling and morally sound lives (Eudaimonia) [1]. As for addressing risk and uncertainty, virtue ethics focuses on practical wisdom [1] that enables individuals to make sound judgments in uncertain situations by understanding the right course of action and balancing different virtues. It also states that a well-developed moral character helps individuals navigate through unpredictable and challenging circumstances, and it allows context-sensitive decisions to unique situations and uncertainties.
Neuralink, the leading company in the industry, stated as its mission to “create a generalized brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs today and unlock human potential tomorrow” [2]. In the last couple of decades technology has already changed a major part of our lives and this new high-tech company, Neuralink, wants to enter a field that was thought to be invincible until now, the human mind. Although it has many potentials and can widely benefit the society, we all know the concerns that can arise rightfully when a private corporation is involved in the development of an innovative technology.
One of the main ethical issues regarding Neuralink is the data privacy. The direct connection between these computer chips and a brain enables completely new ways for data mining and one can have access to data that was not available before at all. This raises many risks and uncertainties considering the company’s data usage policy. Let us assume the scenario where BCIs are widely used among the people and Neuralink can harvest a load of data from its users. They can use this data to develop and improve their product and to introduce new features to enhance and make the overall experience better for the users, getting one step closer to achieve their mission statement. However, there is a major risk that in our capitalized world, Neuralink will use this data in morally unacceptable ways for financial purposes and take advantage of the revealed weaknesses and possibilities to have more control over its user base. And as for the users, informed consent [1] would be vital for the process from a virtuous perspective as the common people might not want to use these computer chips if they knew what access they are going to give out. Without the right education about the product, people might feel scammed or betrayed when they realize how this chip would actually affect their lives in the long run and what kind of data Neuralink would have access to from now on.
If we consider all these risks and uncertainties from the virtue ethics aspect, then we can conclude that a lot can depend on the certain characteristics of the main decision makers at Neuralink. Their actions are morally acceptable if and only if that action is what a virtuous agent would do in the circumstances. In this case, a virtuous employee at Neuralink, in my opinion, would be a long-term thinking individual, who places the overall well-being of humanity above their financial possibilities and their desire for power. This person must be courageous enough to seek the new ways of innovation but should also know the boundaries that are not to be crossed. This person must know exactly what he needs to improve their product and concentrate only on that thing, only for this purpose. If the people at Neuralink have these characteristics, then I think it would justify their decisions on data usage. From the virtuous perspective, the founder of Neuralink, Elon Musk, has these certain characteristics. He is already one of the richest people in the world [3] therefore he does not need Neuralink for financial purposes. Additionally, his other companies reflect that he is committed to make the future brighter and his strong opinion about AI [4] shows that he is aware of the technological boundaries that humanity should be cautious about. Assuming Elon Musk represents the employees at his company, we can conclude that it is morally acceptable to trust them to develop access to the human brain and handle the data gained from there.
