# TODO

## NavBar

- Make it work even when zoomed in (it fails at least on iPhone)
- Adjust shadow
- Make it highlight links based on the proportion of viewport coverage, not on the visible parts (bad for long sections) ((The first item in this section must be related to this))

## Sections

- Check font-weight for section title
